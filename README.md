# blockchain-learning
This repo is a sandbox to leverage my python experience into learning blockchain development with Solidity

IDE: VS Code
Extensions:
* Solidity
* Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum (Microsoft)
* Vyper

Resources:
Text:
* https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/programming-languages/python/


Video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bzPE9ydGlo << vs code extensions for solidiy


Notes:
* vyper does not strive to replace solidity
* recommends testing with Brownie and pytest
* Brownie installs eth-utils


* Issue:
** No version pragma in 'contracts/Storage.vy'
# @version ^0.2.0
* solve vyper extension issues like so: https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/discussions/2248#discussioncomment-187742
* py-evm install error - is actually error installing pyethash in windows
** https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/issues/850
** https://github.com/ethereum/ethash/issues/104#issue-269396285

Open Questions:
* Truffle, Infura, and OpenZeppelin.  << what are these?
